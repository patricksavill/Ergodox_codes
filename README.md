# Ergodox basic programming

Due to something strange happening at IC it is important to use https://configurator.input.club/alpha/ to get any firmware to configure the Ergodox, the main site will royally mess with your keyboard.

Download the flash software: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bw4kMf0s-ZBSSExrd296blVHRk0/view, or find it zipped in 3rd_party_zips. 

# Custom LED layer icons #

To update the LED layers follow the instructions in these links:  
-https://input.club/forums/topic/ied-lcd-editor-v0-9-gui-editor-to-modify-the-lcd/  
-https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=82904.0. 

Both threads are needed as each has slightly different information  
The software needed to update the binaries to flash to your keyboard can be found in the second thread, with direct link:  
DL link https://geekhack.org/index.php?action=dlattach;topic=82904.0;attach=141569
